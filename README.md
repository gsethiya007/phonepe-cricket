INPUT: players in each team, the number of overs and their batting
       order as input. Input overs ball by ball with the runs scored on that ball (could be
       wide, no ball or a wicket as well).
OUTPUT: expected to print individual scores, number of balls faced, number of 4s, number of 6s
        for all the players from the batting side at the end of every over. Need to print total
        score, total wickets. Essentially, you need to keep a track of all the players, strike changes (at
        the end of the over or after taking singles or 3s) and maintain their scores, also keep track of
        extra bowls that are being bowled (like wides or no balls). Need to print which team
        won the match at the end.
